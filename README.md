# Note-maker - An [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that makes your note-making easier!

The main features (Planned, not implemented):
- [ ] Allows you to define the name of the file *before* the file is created so that templates can more easily utilize the filename.
- [ ] Allows you to select the folder the file should be created in *before* the file is created, so that template-plugins may select an appropriate template based on the location
- [ ] Allows you to select/override the template to use when the file has been created

## Installation
